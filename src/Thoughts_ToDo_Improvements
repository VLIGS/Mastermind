* Should use Set for colours rather than List because Set does not allow duplicates, but then need to reimplement CodeGenerator
* Display uses System.out.println to communicate with user, but may need to use different mode of communication
* Provide different implementations for one of the classes, such as random generator, to demonstrate flexibility, could
have one that generates code that has all same colours to make it clear which implementation is running
* Adapt tests to different length of code
* Add more tests
* Refactor to see if functional programming can be incorporated
* Test with different length of code and tries
