Code Generator(cg)
    cg1: getCode(PegColour, int) vs getCode(int) //better decoupling if pass in PegColour as parameter


Peg(pe)
    pe1: Inconsistent naming Peg (interface) & PegImpl (class implementing Peg interface) vs PegInterface & Peg (class implementing PegInteface)

GameImpl(gi)

    gi1: Create PegColour instance to pass in, connected to cg1
    gi2: Instantiate codeGenerator in constructor rather than in runGames //need to think whether codeGenerator might change during the game

NumberOfPegs(ni)
    ni1: instead of simple integer use class for the purposes of dependency injection

Display(ds)
    ds1: don't have setNumberOfGuessesAllowed, setShowCode, setCode
    ds2: pass in PegColour pegColour, int NumberOfPegs, int NumberOfGuesses into displayInstructions
    ds3: changed displayInstructions to remove hardcoding of initial number of tries and number of pegs
    ds4: overloaded displayInstructions to just pass in simple string

ErrorChecker(ec)
    er1: implemented isValidGuess by passing in all the necessary parameters for checking rather than relying on internal parameters
